# NOAA Data Analisys and Visualisation using Spyre

In this project, we receive data from the official website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, [noaa.gov](https://www.noaa.gov/)), create a correct dataset, analyze and visualize it.

The Spyre module was used for visualization, and a previous work ([Data_Science_1](https://github.com/sermax778/Data_Science_1)) was modified for data acquisition.
Now we only need to get the data once, after which a file with all the received data (complete_dataset.csv) will be created.

We collect the following data:
- Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)
- Temperature Condition Index (TCI)
- Vegetation Health Index (VHI)

We also have 25 regions of Ukraine in which these indicators are available to us.

To display the required graph or table, we enter a range of weeks.
